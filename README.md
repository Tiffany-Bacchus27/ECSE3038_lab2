# ECSE3038_lab2

This lab was designed to be FastAPI based for 
managing a list of persons in a JSON containing 'name', 'occupation', and 'age'.
It is supported by two main operations: 
POST - adds a new person to the data
GET  - retreives a list of all the persons stored in the datastore.
The function 'add_person' receives the field from the dictionary, checks that none of the fields
are empty. Once all fields are provided, the new person is added to the data list. Then a success response is 
returned with the added person's details.  
      The 'get_people' retreives all the people currently stores in the data list and returns
      a list of JSON objects each representing a person with their name, occupation and age. 


This code was written as part of a programming assignment to practice building POST requests 
in FastAPI.                                      


My favorite Pokemon is Snorlax! He's forever a mood. 
A laidback powerhouse but also a giant snuggly bear that sleeps all day?
Plus its tank/defense traits make him tough to beat in battles.

Honarary Mention: Jiggly Puff, I love a playful mischevious character.
